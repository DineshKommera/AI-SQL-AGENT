# SQL_Database_Agent

I'm excited to share a project I recently completed where I combined LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI, and FastAPI to create a natural language interface for querying and managing a SQL database! 🧠💬🗃️

🎯 What it does:

Converts natural language into executable SQL queries

Supports full CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Uses GPT-4 with LangGraph for multi-step reasoning

Integrated with FastAPI to expose a clean REST API

Built-in memory for multi-turn conversations

Tool-chaining for structured, modular operations

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python, LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, FastAPI, SQLite

💡 What I learned:

How to build intelligent agents with memory and tools

Using LangGraph for structured, stateful reasoning

Exposing AI pipelines through web APIs

Translating ambiguous user input into secure, executable actions
